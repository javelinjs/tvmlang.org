TVM is an end-to-end computation compiler for deep learning frameworks. An impressive feature is its ability to deploy computation workloads on different platforms, such as GPUs and mobile phones (will support more hardward backends, such as FPGA devices, in future).

Typically it is hard to test different computation workloads on a heterogeneous device. In order to optimize a computation task, one has to edit the code on the development PC, compile, deploy to the device, test, then modify the codes again to see whether it accelerates. The workflow looks like,

Is there any way to speed up this process? 

Today we introduce an approach to deploy and test TVM workloads on Android Phones. We develop a TVM runtime for Java and build an Android APP upon it. The Android APP takes shared library as input and runs compiled functions on the mobile phone. Thus our workflow simplifies to,

With the help of the TVM RPC, one can build TVM functions and NDArrays on a remote device. The ability to cross-compile to different platforms makes it easy to develop on one platform and test on another. 

The process is illustrated as following:

## Run TVM APP on Android Phone

You can find Android RPC APP in [apps/android_rpc](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/apps/android_rpc). Please follow the instruction to build for your Android device. Once the APK is built, sign it using `apps/android_rpc/dev_tools` and install it on the phone. The APP looks like:

{:center: style="text-align: center"}
![image](/images/android_rpc/app.png){: width="25%"}
![image](/images/android_rpc/app_error.png){: width="25%"}
{:center}

Usually we cannot start a standalone server on mobile phone, instead we start an proxy server and use our app to connect.

```bash
python -m tvm.exec.rpc_proxy
```

## Create NDArray on the Phone

Now we can connect to the proxy server from the laptop:

```python
from tvm.contrib import rpc
remote = rpc.connect("0.0.0.0", 9090, key="android")
```

This will give us a handler `remote` which we can use to communicate with the mobile phone. For instance, the following lines create a 1024x1024 matrix on phone's GPU:

```python
A = tvm.nd.array(
	np.random.uniform(size=(1024, 1024)).astype(dtype),
	ctx = remote.cl(0))
```

When `A.asnumpy()` is called from the laptop, the matrix `A `will be copied to phone's RAM and then transfer to the laptop through the proxy server. The TVM RPC interface is transparent to users.


## GEMM (Matrix Multiplication) on the Phone

Now we are going to introduce how to test matrix multiplication on an Android phone. First let's define the very simple GEMM schedule:

```python
import tvm
def gemm(N, bn):
    A = tvm.placeholder((N, N), name='A')
    B = tvm.placeholder((N, N), name='B')
    k = tvm.reduce_axis((0, N), name='k')

    C = tvm.compute(
        (N, N),
        lambda ii, jj: tvm.sum(A[ii, k] * B[k, jj], axis=k),
        name='C')

    s = tvm.create_schedule(C.op)

    block_x = tvm.thread_axis("blockIdx.x")
    thread_x = tvm.thread_axis("threadIdx.x")

    bo, bi = s[C].split(C.op.axis[0], factor=bn)
    to, ti = s[C].split(C.op.axis[1], factor=bn)
    s[C].bind(bi, block_x)
    s[C].bind(ti, thread_x)

    print(tvm.lower(s, [A, B, C], simple_mode=True))

    return tvm.build(s, [A, B, C],
    	"opencl",
    	target_host="llvm -target=arm64-linux-android",
    	name="gemm_gpu")
```

There's nothing special except the last line. Here we set the target to 'opencl' since this is the computation language which our Mali GPU supports. Note that we set `target_host` to '`llvm -target=arm64-linux-android`', it depends on what architecture your Android Phone is. We tested on Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, which has a Mali-T760 GPU. Here is the CPU info for this phone,

```bash
$ adb shell
shell@zenltechn:/ $ cat /proc/cpuinfo                                          
Processor	: AArch64 Processor rev 2 (aarch64)

processor	: 2

Hardware	: SAMSUNG Exynos7420
``` 

Please refer to [target triple](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html#target-triple) to learn the compile options for LLVM.

We use `tvm.contrib.ndk` to build the shared library for the Android system,

```python
from tvm.contrib import rpc, util, ndk
N = 1024
f = gemm(N, bn = 256)
temp = util.tempdir()
path_dso = temp.relpath("gemm_gpu.so")
f.export_library(path_dso, ndk.create_shared)
```

`ndk.create_shared` reads the environment variable `TVM_NDK_CC` to find the compiler & linker for the Android device. We can easily use NDK to generate standalone toolchain for our device. For example, the following commands generate standalone compilers and linkers for ARM64 Android devices.

```bash
cd /opt/android-ndk/build/tools/
./make-standalone-toolchain.sh --platform=android-24 --use-llvm --arch=arm64 --install-dir=/opt/android-toolchain-arm64
```

If everything goes right, we've got a shared library 'gemm_gpu.so'. Now let's upload it to the mobile phone, make the phone load the module and get a remote handler,

```python
remote = rpc.connect("0.0.0.0", 9090, key="android")

remote.upload(path_dso)
f = remote.load_module("gemm_gpu.so")
```

Create the remote arrays and print the running time,

```python
ctx = remote.cl(0)

import numpy as np
a_np = np.random.uniform(size=(N, N)).astype("float32")
b_np = np.random.uniform(size=(N, N)).astype("float32")

a = tvm.nd.array(a_np, ctx)
b = tvm.nd.array(b_np, ctx)
c = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros((N, N), dtype="float32"), ctx)

time_f = f.time_evaluator(f.entry_name, ctx, number=5)
cost = time_f(a, b, c).mean
print('%g secs/op, %g GFLOPS' % (cost, ngflops(N) / cost))
```

Now we can verify the results on PC,

```python
np.testing.assert_almost_equal(
	c.asnumpy(),
	a_np.dot(b_np),
	decimal=3)
```

In the case above, we develop and cross-compile to a binary file for our mobile phone. Through the proxy server, the binary is uploaded to the phone and run in its JVM. This approach makes it easy to develop and test different computation workloads on Android.

## Java Runtime for TVM

The Android APP is built on top of the Java runtime, which provides minimum supports for TVM Function and NDArray. Here's an example for registering function in tvm4j,

```java
Function func = Function.convertFunc(new Function.Callback() {
      @Override public Object invoke(TVMValue... args) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        for (TVMValue arg : args) {
          res.append(arg.asString());
        }
        return res.toString();
      }
    });
TVMValue res = func.pushArg("Hello").pushArg(" ").pushArg("World!").invoke();
assertEquals("Hello World!", res.asString());
res.release();
func.release();
```

As we have seen in the GEMM part, one can build shared library by Python and execute it by Java,

```java
import ml.dmlc.tvm.Module;
import ml.dmlc.tvm.NDArray;
import ml.dmlc.tvm.TVMContext;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class LoadAddFunc {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String loadingDir = args[0];
    Module fadd = Module.load(loadingDir + File.separator + "add_cpu.so");

    TVMContext ctx = TVMContext.cpu();
    
    long[] shape = new long[]{2};
    NDArray arr = NDArray.empty(shape, ctx);
    arr.copyFrom(new float[]{3f, 4f});
    NDArray res = NDArray.empty(shape, ctx);
    
    fadd.entryFunc().pushArg(arr).pushArg(arr).pushArg(res).invoke();
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(res.asFloatArray()));

    arr.release();
    res.release();
    fadd.release();
  }
}
```

Once you have built TVM library following the [Installation Guide](http://docs.tvmlang.org/how_to/install.html), run

```bash
make jvmpkg
make jvminstall
```

This will compile, package and install tvm4j in your local maven repository. Please refer to [tvm4j](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/jvm) for more information.

## Remote Profile and Test on iPhone/iPad

Besides the Android RPC application, we also provide an [iOS RPC app](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/apps/ios_rpc), through which we can easily profile and test TVM computation workloads on iPhone or iPad. It works almost the same as that on Android, while XCode and an iOS device are required.
